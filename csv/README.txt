Note 1: There are 2 CSVs, one that pertains to the Parkers Mill route and one that uses a less efficient Versailles route.  [1] The Parkers Mill CSV should ideally produce poor scores when run through the network. [2] Ideally, the Versailles route should produce strong scores when run through the network.
Note 2: Each CSV has 3 columns: [1] longitude, [2] latitude, [3] distance between the previous coordinate and the current coordinate.  Feel free to discard the distance column, I left it in for personal reference.
Note 3: Each route can contain more coordinates than I listed in the CSVs.  The polyline-to-gps approach I used, only produces the coordinates used in the polyline that describes the route.  Said approach is imperfect in that it skips coordinate pairs that are between polyline vertices.  This polyline approach seemed appropriate for quickly getting a pool of useful GPS coordinates, but later this week I will try to find a different approach that produces more coordinates (if we deem that it is necessary).  I hope the current CSVs are enough to allow us to be productive in the meantime.
Note 4: Because of Note 3, I felt that I shouldn't filter out coordinates that are <30m distance away from their nearest neighbor.  Filtering might leave too few coordinates for testing at the moment.
